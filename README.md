# B-Tree-Indexing
This project simulates the implementation of B-Tree indexing for efficient data storage and retrieval. The focus is on creating a B-Tree structure that emulates how records would be stored and organized. Key functionalities include insertion, deletion, and search operations within the simulated B-Tree.
